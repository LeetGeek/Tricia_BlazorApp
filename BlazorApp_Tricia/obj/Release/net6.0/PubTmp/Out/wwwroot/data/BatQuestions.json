    "Answers": [
      "The intensity of the sound wave will decrease.",
      "The intensity of the sounds wave will increase.",
      "The time it takes the echo to return from ear to ear will get steadily longer from echo to echo.",

    "QuestionText": "What is the difference in muscle contractions in humans and bats?",
    "Answers": [
      "In humans, muscle contractions are intentional, whereas in bats they are automatic.",
      "In humans, activating muscles results in contracting tendons, whereas in bats, it results in relaxing them.",
      "In humans, some muscles are relaxed during sleep, whereas in bats, muscles are always activated.",
      "In humans, muscles cannot cause them to get off the ground, whereas bats can use their muscles to get off of the ground."

    "QuestionText": "Imagine that a bat is hunting a cluster of grasshoppers at night. How would they isolate the slowest and smallest grasshopper?",
    "Answers": [
      "A smaller object will reflect less of the soundwave, so they will search for the smallest one.",
      "The smallest grasshopper would run the slowest, so they use echolocation to determine where it is.",
      "They would compare the sizes and lengths of the sound waves looking for the shortest and least intense wave.",
      "They would rely on instincts and look for the insect at the back of the cluster."

    "QuestionText": "Suppose a bat dies while it is sleeping. What will happen if it dies while hanging upside down?",
    "Answers": [
      "It will collapse and fall to the ground when it dies.",
      "Like human fingers, bats will relax their muscles and let go of the surface. ",
      "Their muscles will get stiff from rigor mortis causing them to remain in place.",
      "Gravity will pull on the bat’s body, keeping the talons closed, and it will remain upside down."
